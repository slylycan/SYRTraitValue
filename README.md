## **Colors traits based on their value**



![Image](https://i.imgur.com/s8csNp7.png)

Gives traits a numerical value that represents roughly how beneficial they are. The traits are then colored based on this value. Then, other mod makers may use this value to manipulate the traits based on it.

Settings allow you to change the value for any trait, even from mods that don't have this framework implemented. Use this to adjust values to your playstyle (say you think Teetotaler is horrible, give it a fat -30!).
There is also a setting to disable colors. For now, it requires a restart to apply properly.
